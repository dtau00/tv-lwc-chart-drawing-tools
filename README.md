  <h1>TradingView Lightweight Chartsâ„¢ : Chart Drawing Tools plug-in</h1>

</div>

<!-- markdownlint-enable no-inline-html -->

Chart Drawing Tools is a plug-in to allow users to perform one of the most requested functions of the lightweight charts library, add Chart Drawings!  My goal is to build a solid framework that includes the plumbing, so others can focus on simply adding new drawing.  We will start by focusing on the core drawing functionalities, develop more advanced features such as syncing of drawings between charts, then extend it for deeper integration, such as an API to communicate with the plug-in to, say, externally manage orders with drawings in the plug-in.

Check /docs/...drawio.pdf for more informaiton.

This is a very early preview build; the architecture and structure is still being worked on.  So it is still missing a lot of core features, and expect major breaking changes.  We will be adding test cases once the structure is more solidified.
