sub-tool bar to allow additional customization of drawing

allow users to modify styling
allow user to modify drawing size and position
  - adjust shape
  - move
  - add text
allow selected drawing tool to persist between charts
support drawings beyond availalbe data / projection
We have a drawing object, that applies the drawing, but then we have to apply it to multiple charts
    whenever a drawing is updated, we have apply 
    that to all relevant charts (add, update, remove).  We dont need to do this for every drawing.
deselect selected drawing on rclick
more drawings to get a feel of how to further break down drawing class and views
check dispsol of all event handlers (tools, subtools, charts, etc..)
the plumbing of primaties is not right.  charts is still messing with it
do i even need to track primatives?  can i apply the same primitive to different charts?  add, modify, remove?  and it
will be internally handled by chart
